This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## ðŸš€ Database Integration & User Progress 

- Integrated scalable PostgreSQL database (Supabase) using Prisma ORM for type-safe, performant access.
- Added NextAuth.js authentication with Google OAuth for secure user login and session management.
- Implemented secure API endpoints for user progress, analytics, and preferences, all protected by authentication.
- Linked progress tracking UI to the database for logged-in usersâ€”progress is now persistent and user-specific.
- Role-based access control (admin/user) for secure admin endpoints.
